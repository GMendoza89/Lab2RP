Repo for the lab number 2 of Pattern Recognition subject.
The idea is to extract texture characteristics from an gray level image using
the following methods:
    -Gray-level covariance matrix.
    -Gray-level run length.
    -Sums and differences histograms.

From each of the techniques, several statistics will be extracted, which will then
be passed to a PCA algorithm, to obtain the final characteristics.

The files necessary for the computing of the GRLR matrix where obtained from the
following link:
